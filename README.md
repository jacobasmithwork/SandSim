# SandSim
A simple python-based sand simulation that served as my intro into visualizing cellular automota.

Hello! This is a simple sand simulation made by Jacob Smith. There is only one
particle type for now, being a generic falling sand. This was a way for me to learn
how to use the graphics.py library, and to work more with cellular automota.
This is the project that got me more into instant visual feedback, and inspired me
to make my p5 js web projects later. Enjoy!
